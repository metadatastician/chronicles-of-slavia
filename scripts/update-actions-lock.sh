# Refresh actions.lock under one unambiguous policy boundary:
#
# - when actions.lock is present, gh actions-lock is authoritative for direct
#   and transitive commit resolution, so its symbolic workflow refs are kept;
# - when actions.lock is absent, the separate workflow gate requires inline
#   immutable SHAs.
#
# Verification is treated as observational even though released tool versions
# can rewrite workflow bytes. Updates keep tool-authored workflow changes, but
# any failed update rolls both workflows and the lock back atomically.
